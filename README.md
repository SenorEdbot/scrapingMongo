### Small Notes
This homework felt like 5 steps backwards compared to other homeworks. I think it might have been the 2 week long break - potentially should've had this due during break. That way we could come back from break ready to get a refresher and dive straight into projects. 

I wanted to try and get a MERN stack application running but ran out of time because I didn't slot enough time after getting this version of the assignemnt working.
